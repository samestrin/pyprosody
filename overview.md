# Overview

## 1. Overview

**PyProsody** is a command-line Python application that takes a text file (a story) and, optionally, a model argument. Its main functionality is twofold:

* **Emotion Analysis:** Break the story into sentences and phrases, then use a hybrid analysis (lexical, sentiment, contextual, sarcasm/irony, pragmatic/discourse, and feature engineering) to detect emotional cues.
* **Expressive Audio Generation:** Convert the analyzed text into a speech audio file by adjusting prosodic parameters—such as speed, tone, and volume—to reflect the detected emotions.

Local AI models will be leveraged as much as possible to ensure the application is self-contained and does not rely on external APIs.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

The system should be designed with a modular, pipeline-based architecture, including:

* **CLI Frontend:**

  * Uses Python’s `argparse` to accept the text file and an optional model.
  * Acts as the entry point to the application.

* **Text Processing Module:**

  * Reads and segments the input story into smaller elements (paragraphs, sentences, phrases).
  * Libraries: Consider using **NLTK** or **spaCy** for tokenization and sentence boundary detection.

* **Emotion Analysis Module:**

  * **Lexical Analysis:** Use pre-built sentiment dictionaries (e.g., AFINN or SentiWordNet) for basic scoring.
  * **Sentiment & Contextual Analysis:** Integrate local, pre-trained transformer models (e.g., fine-tuned variants of DistilBERT) for nuanced sentiment analysis.
  * **Sarcasm and Irony Detection:** Incorporate or fine-tune a dedicated model if available; alternatively, design rule-based heuristics.
  * **Pragmatic/Discourse Analysis & Feature Engineering:** Combine outputs from multiple methods to generate a robust emotion profile for each text segment.

* **Audio Generation Module:**

  * Utilize a local TTS engine (such as **Tacotron2**, **Glow-TTS**, or another open-source solution).
  * Adjust prosody parameters (speed, pitch, volume) based on the emotion analysis.
  * Combine generated segments (using tools like **pydub**) into a single audio file.

* **Integration & Orchestration Layer:**

  * Coordinates the flow from reading the text, processing it, analyzing emotions, to generating the final audio output.
  * Ensures error handling, logging, and smooth communication between modules.

## 3. Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Requirements & Research

* **Duration:** 1–2 weeks

* **Activities:**

  * Define functional and non-functional requirements.
  * Research local AI models for sentiment and sarcasm detection.
  * Evaluate open-source TTS engines that support fine-grained prosody control.

### Phase 2: Architecture & Design

* **Duration:** 1 week

* **Activities:**

  * Create module-level design diagrams.
  * Define data flow and interfaces between the text processor, emotion analyzer, and TTS generator.
  * Plan for extensibility (e.g., adding more analysis components later).

### Phase 3: Implementation

* **Duration:** 3–4 weeks

* **Activities:**

  * **CLI Development:**
    * Build a simple command-line interface with options for the text file and model selection.

  * **Text Processing Module:**
    * Implement text segmentation using libraries like NLTK/spaCy.

  * **Emotion Analysis Module:**

    * Integrate lexical, sentiment, and contextual analysis.
    * Experiment with local models from Hugging Face and build rule-based heuristics for sarcasm/irony and discourse features.

  * **Audio Generation Module:**

    * Integrate a local TTS model.
    * Develop a mapping mechanism to adjust TTS prosody based on emotion scores.

  * **Integration:**

    * Assemble the components into a coherent pipeline.
    * Ensure intermediate outputs are validated.

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation

* **Duration:** 1–2 weeks

* **Activities:**

  * **Unit Testing:** Write tests for each module (text segmentation, emotion scoring, TTS output).
  * **Integration Testing:** Validate end-to-end functionality using sample stories.
  * **User Testing:** Gather feedback on the emotional expressiveness and naturalness of the generated audio.
  * **Performance Testing:** Ensure the system works efficiently with longer texts.

### Phase 5: Deployment & Documentation

* **Duration:** 1 week

* **Activities:**

  * Package the application using tools like `setuptools` or `poetry`.
  * Create comprehensive documentation and usage examples.
  * Set up version control and continuous integration (CI) for ongoing development.

## 5. Risk Management & Mitigation

* **Emotion Analysis Accuracy:**

  * _Risk:_ Hybrid methods might not capture complex emotions accurately.
  * _Mitigation:_ Iteratively refine models and heuristics; include fallback mechanisms and allow for manual tuning.

* **TTS Prosody Control:**

  * _Risk:_ Adjusting prosodic parameters to convincingly replicate emotions can be challenging.
  * _Mitigation:_ Experiment with different TTS models and parameter mappings; incorporate user feedback.

* **Performance Issues:**

  * _Risk:_ The pipeline may slow down with long texts.
  * _Mitigation:_ Optimize text segmentation and parallelize processing where possible.

* **Local Model Limitations:**

  * _Risk:_ Local models might not be as robust as cloud-based ones.
  * _Mitigation:_ Carefully select and fine-tune models; provide clear documentation on limitations.

## 6. Final Deliverables

* **PyProsody CLI Application:** Fully functional, modular application.
* **Source Code & Documentation:** Well-commented code with user guides and developer documentation.
* **Test Suite:** Comprehensive tests for both unit and integration levels.
* **Deployment Package:** Instructions and scripts for installation and deployment.
